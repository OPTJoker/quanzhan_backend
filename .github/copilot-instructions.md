## Project Context
This is a comprehensive AI development learning project for Go developers. The project focuses on:

1. **Progressive Learning**: From basic ML concepts to advanced AI implementations
2. **Technology Stack**: Go backend, Python for ML/AI, MySQL for data storage, Redis for caching
3. **Practical Applications**: Real-world AI scenarios with production-ready code

## Code Generation Guidelines

### Language Preferences
- Use **Go** for backend services, APIs, data pipelines, and infrastructure
- Use **Python** for machine learning, deep learning, and AI model implementations
- Integrate both languages seamlessly for optimal performance

### Architecture Patterns
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use interfaces for dependency injection
- Include comprehensive tests and documentation

### Database Integration
- Use MySQL for persistent data storage
- Implement Redis for caching and session management
- Follow database best practices with proper indexing and optimization

### AI/ML Best Practices
- Include data validation and preprocessing
- Implement proper model versioning
- Add monitoring and metrics collection
- Consider scalability and performance optimization

### Code Structure
- Organize code by domain and functionality
- Include examples that progress from simple to complex
- Provide clear documentation and comments
- Add practical exercises and challenges
